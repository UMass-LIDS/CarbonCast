./get_gribtab.sh             makes gribtable
../../make_gribtable.sh      makes gribtable.dat

./get_gribtab.sh
mv gribtab gribtable
../../make_gribtable.sh

So the differences are in the removal of level information which 
is the correct thing to do.  These files should not have "hourly"
in their definition.  Maybe it will be corrected in the next update.



1/29/2021:  (old directory structure

./get_gribtab.sh
mv gribtab gribtable

no other changes
diff gribtable.dat gribtable.dat.1.2018 only shows additions
../../check_dup_gribtable.sh show no duplicates

No manual changes!!! did cleanuped webpages or Manfred's new download script fix the problems?
